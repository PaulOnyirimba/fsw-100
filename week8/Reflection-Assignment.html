    <h1>Reflection Assignment</h1>
    <p>This was my first hands on experience with website design. i am happy to say I have completed the course. While completing this course there were several things I learned along the way.i learned how to make a website responsive which is something that really stood out to me.</p>
    <p>This course also taught me that there are several things you can do to your website as a website developer. One of my favorite things about this program is typing in codes and going live with my website. I really enjoy seeing what I have created. There were a few frustrations I had along the way. If it is not perfectly typed and applied to Visual Studio Code you will not see what you are expecting to see. You have to double check your commands and make sure they are correct otherwise the changes will not reflect on your website.</p>
